# StewardHouse — Project Manifest

Operating context for Claude Code in this repository. Read at the start of every
session. Update as locked decisions change.

---

## 1. Project

**StewardHouse** is a philanthropic planning and education platform for athletes,
their advisors, and athletic departments. The platform is **structural, never
advisory or fiduciary** — it organizes what an advisor or funder decides; it does
not decide for them. Phase 1 scope is **athletes only** (no music / entertainment
/ creator language in user-facing copy).

The core concept is **bilateral transparency** — a two-sided transparency layer
between individual funder and nonprofit, expressed through the **Giving
Partnership Profile (GPP)** (two narrative layers: Giving Style + Giving Identity;
no scores, no grades).

This build is a prototype / stress-test tool, not production. Quality over speed.
Stress-test before moving forward; build it right once.

**Four user-facing surfaces** under `src/surfaces/` (plus a public landing):
- **`individual/`** — funder-facing experience (paused at v0.6.1)
- **`advisor/`** — the advisor surface ("Philanthropic Advisor" in customer copy)
- **`enterprise/`** — institutions (athletic departments, Phase 1)
- **`operations/`** — internal StewardHouse staff view (Overview redesigned 2026)
- **`landing/`** — public entry

---

## 2. Stack & commands

- **React 18 + Vite + react-router-dom**. Plain `.jsx`, no TypeScript.
- **Inline styles over CSS custom properties** — every color, spacing, radius,
  type-size token lives in `src/styles/tokens.css` as `--sh-*`. Use
  `var(--sh-*)` in component styles. **No hex literals in components.**
- **Fixture-driven**, no backend. Source fixtures live in `src/data/`; the
  unified data layer (see §4) reads them via adapters and exposes a query API.
- **Auto-deploys to Cloudflare Pages on push to `main`.**

Commands:
- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server (auto-picks a port if 5173 is taken)
- `npm run build` — production build; the only consistent warning is the
  pre-existing chunk-size note for the single-bundle output
- **Node data verification pattern** (used in slice-verify scripts):
  ```sh
  node --input-type=module -e "import('./src/data/unified/index.js').then(({default: u}) => { ... })"
  ```
  Temp `.mjs` verify scripts at the project root are conventional for slice
  verification; remove after the slice banks.

## 4. Unified data layer (`src/data/unified/`)

Adapter-over-existing pattern: customer-surface fixtures (`enterpriseFixtures.js`,
`clients.js`, `individualProfile.js`, `orgsData.js`, `cohorts.js`) are NOT
migrated. Each adapter reads its source and emits unified-shape records.
Assemble concatenates per-source bundles and wires deferred FKs.

### Nine entities

`persons`, `institutions`, `advisorPractices`, `programParticipations`,
`gifts`, `orgs`, `cohorts`, `connectionRequests`, `issues`.

Every record carries `sourceSurface` ∈ `'individual' | 'advisor' | 'enterprise'
| 'synthetic'`. IDs are namespaced: `p-{sourceSurface}-{native-id}`,
`gift-{sourceSurface}-{seq}`, `cr-synthetic-{seq}`, `issue-synthetic-{seq}`,
etc. **Same-person dedup across surfaces is deferred** — Marcus appears as
`p-individual-c-001`, `p-advisor-c-001`, AND `p-enterprise-1` (three Person
records, no merging).

**Shape note (Candid interleave 2026-06):** `Person.extensions.individual.causes`
is a string-ID array (e.g. `['education','sports','economic']`) — same shape as
`Org.causes`. Consumers resolve labels from the `CAUSES` taxonomy at render time,
so cause-label changes in `intakeData.js` propagate without re-shipping fixtures.

### Four source bundles (assembled into one store)

`enterprise` (21 persons + 1 institution + 16 participations + 18 gifts) ·
`advisor` (9 persons + 1 practice + 9 participations + 2 cohorts) ·
`individual` (1 person + 3 gifts + 17 orgs) ·
`synthetic` (51 individuals + 14 staff/advisor + 3 institutions + 6 practices
+ 51 participations + 105 ConnectionRequests + 14 Issues). Live composition:
**342 records across 9 entity types**.

### Five `runChecks` suites (all live, all passing)

- `assemble.runChecks` — composition integrity (sum-of-sources === assembled),
  global ID uniqueness within each entity type, FK orphan resolution across
  participations / practices / institutions / gifts / connection-requests /
  issues.
- `synthetic.runChecks` — entity counts, sourceSurface tags, FK resolution
  within bundle, first-name uniqueness + collision with real-person set,
  CR stage-count + monotonic timestamps + `gaveAt === Gift.date`, Issue
  enum + status/timestamp coherence + relatedEntity coupling.
- `{enterprise,advisor,individual}.runChecks` — per-adapter counts, FK
  resolution within bundle, self-tests on parsers (`parseGiftLabel`,
  `parseGiftDate`), informational `.info` (gift event-vs-field divergence,
  null-givingPlan count).

### Public read API (`unified.*`)

Direct entity arrays — `persons`, `institutions`, `advisorPractices`,
`programParticipations`, `gifts`, `orgs`, `cohorts`, `connectionRequests`,
`issues`.

Query helpers — `personsBy({type, sourceSurface})`,
`participationsByContext(contextId)`, `giftsByGiver(personId)`,
`countBy(entityName, predicate?)`, `byId(entityName, id)`.

Aggregate-default projections — `connectionFunnel()` (cumulative-reached
funnel, monotonically non-increasing), `connectionFunnelBy({sourceSurface})`,
`pilotMetrics()` (totalIndividuals, per-stage counts, conversions,
`totalDollarsAtGave`, `distinctOrgsAtGave`, `medianDaysMatchedToGave`),
`recentActivity({limit})` (sorted timestamp desc — CR stage transitions +
Issue events; gifts deduped via the CR `gave` transition),
`platformHealth()` (5 runChecks suites + composition + informational +
externalMonitoring), `openIssueCount()`, `openIssues()` (sorted openedAt
desc), `issueCountByStatus()`, `issueCountByCategory()`.

Record-level (explicit, not default landing data) —
`connectionsByGiver(personId)`, `connectionsByTarget(orgIdOrName)`.

## 5. Surface status

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| **Operations Overview** | **Complete and QA'd.** Overview ships 8 redesign slices (A–H, 2026-06); QA audit on branch `qa-audit-operations` (53 findings + 3 amendments = 56 total, doc at `docs/qa-audit-operations-2026-06-09.md`; **branch unmerged** by design). Fix bundles 1 (a11y highs QA-015–018), 2 (copy + structure QA-001/002/024/054 + lows 025–029), 3 (`801123a` — decision-free fixes QA-003/007/008/020/022/031/037–039/042/043/052, incl. deletion of the dead `UserList` stub), and 4 (`20354cc` — code quality QA-032/033/034/044/046/048/050/053, the `ExpandableRow` extraction, two QA-048 resolvers, three new tokens, and the Mission→Progression internal renames) banked. **Route-pages arc complete** (5 slices, 2026-06): slice 1 deleted the `health` tab + route stub, added Organizations to the nav, wired composition tiles as drills; slices 2–5 shipped live directory pages at `/operations/{individuals,institutions,advisors,organizations}` (77 / 4 / 7 / 17 records, all fixture-faithful with live-derived count headers). **Detail-routes arc complete** (6 slices + Candid interleave, 2026-06): per-record detail routes at `/operations/{dir}/:id` for all four entities — slice 1 (`2d1cf1c` — Institution detail, routing skeleton), 2 (`d327080` — AdvisorPractice detail), 3 (`abe5141` — Organization detail), 4 (`760af13` — Individual detail, type-aware: full view for `type='individual'`, light view for staff/advisor), Candid interleave (`3b7da48` — Organization detail restructured to the GuideStar/Candid profile flow: `foundedYear` literals added to `orgsData.js`, cause label "Economic" → "Economic Mobility" in `intakeData.js`, Person.causes normalized to a string-ID array in `adapters/individual.js`), 5 (`dacde68` — URL-filter state on all four directories: `q` debounced / `source` / `cat` / `causes` / `ids`-override, URL as source of truth, `replace` writes), and 6 (`743de6a` — drill wiring: rows clickable with filter persistence via `location.state.fromQuery`, shared `<AboutLine>` on Issue/Activity expand panels, pre-plan-clients drill behind a build-time derivation gate, ALL FOUR pilot tiles documented-unlinked by founder ruling with per-tile unlock conditions in code) banked. Chrome pattern across detail pages: `<BackLink>` with explicit `to` + `location.state.fromQuery` preservation, shared `<NotFoundCard>` for invalid IDs, dotted-bronze cross-links. **Fix bundle 5** — founder visual cluster: QA-004 (Operations persona wired to `CURRENT_OPS_USER` in new `data/opsFixtures.js`); QA-014 reading A (activity-row chip drops border + adds `cursor:default`, surface accent moves from border to chip text color); QA-021 (muted text inside the Open issues tint card swapped to `--sh-text-secondary` — both the IssueRow meta line and the "Per-issue detail view coming soon." footnote — contrast moves from ~3.46:1 to ~8:1 against `--sh-bg-tint`); QA-030 ruling b1 (`SURFACE_COLORS.Operations` swapped from `--sh-bronze` to `--sh-text-secondary` — Operations now reads quiet internal, distinct from Advisor's bronze). Wontfix per founder ruling: QA-011 (no new funnel footnote, consistent with the pilot-tile decision), QA-013 (SuiteRow copy-to-clipboard defer until attention-state fires), QA-040 (asymmetric `<main>` padding by design), QA-045 (date-helper overlap acceptable per audit), QA-051 (no React.memo at current scale). **Audit posture: 53 of 56 findings resolved**; remaining 3 — QA-023 blocked on a future CR-level filtered view; QA-035 / QA-036 awaiting founder visual review (deferred this round). |
| **Enterprise** | **Built and audited.** All 6 sections live (Overview, Roster, Program, Compliance, Reports (+ 5 sub-pages), Setup wizard). QA audit on branch `qa-audit-enterprise` (173 findings, doc at `docs/qa-audit-enterprise-2026-05-30.md`; **branch unmerged** by design). 9 Criticals + all 33 Highs (#17–42) shipped; Mediums + Lows triaged in `docs/qa-triage-medium-low-2026-05-30.md` (Cluster A/B/C closed). Fixture dates are uniformly shifted −192d for coherence with today (`Enterprise fixture date coherence` commit). |
| **Advisor** | **Built, NEVER QA'd.** 8-section IA (PracticeHome, ClientRoster, ClientWorkspace, CurriculumLibrary, CohortSpace, Pipeline, Documentation, PracticeSettings; plus auxiliary DocCreate/DocDetail/LessonDetail/LessonEditor/DraftsList/CohortDetail). All 9 clients seeded with distinct fictional substance per the locked roster. **No audit doc exists.** |
| **Individual** | **Paused at v0.6.1.** 15 surface files present (Discover, GPSReveal, GivingModeler, Plan, Positioning, Privacy, Team, History, Learn, CohortView, Letter, Questions, Feedback, GiveScreen, IndividualSurface). Frozen until further notice. |
| **Landing** | Single file; public entry. |

## 6. Slice protocol (build discipline)

Every substantive change runs as a **slice**. The rhythm:

1. **Hard git-state gate.** Confirm current branch and HEAD before starting.
   For most slices: `main` at the expected SHA, working tree clean. Refuse to
   proceed if state is unexpected.
2. **Audit + propose.** Investigate read-only; propose a spec with explicit
   scope, decisions, verification plan, and suggested commit message. Hold for
   review. **Do not edit until decisions are locked.**
3. **Feature branch off main.** One slice = one branch (`slice-{letter}-{name}`,
   `fix-{topic}-bundle-{n}`, `docs-{topic}-refresh`, etc.).
4. **Write the slice.** One file at a time when possible; no truncation; no
   "rest unchanged" markers. Flag anything unusual; do not fix unrelated issues
   inline.
5. **Verify.** `npm run build` clean; node smoke against `unified.*` where
   relevant; per-pattern counts for data slices; UI slices add a dev-server
   visual check at the named URL.
6. **HOLD.** Report diffs, verification output, and visual-check URL when
   relevant. Wait for explicit go-ahead.
7. **Commit.** Exact message dictated by the founder. **Never append
   `Co-Authored-By` or any footer.** Never `--amend` after a hook failure (the
   prior commit didn't happen; fix and create a NEW commit).
8. **Bank.** `git checkout main; git merge --ff-only {branch}; git push origin
   main; git branch -d {branch}`. Fast-forward only — refuse if anything
   intervened on main.
9. **Audit branches are never merged or deleted.** `qa-audit-enterprise` and
   `qa-audit-operations` are reference-only and remain on the local clone +
   origin indefinitely. Findings flow into fix-bundle slices that branch off
   `main`, not off the audit branch.

Stop background shells (dev server, watch loops) at bank time. Use `TaskStop`,
not `kill`.

## 7. Guardrails

### Path B — the structural-not-advisory boundary

The platform organizes what advisors and funders decide; it does not decide
for them. **No AI-drafted Giving Partnership Profiles. No custody or payment
rails. No evaluative recommendations.** Test: exposure (in) vs. evaluative
recommendation (out). "You should fund X" or "Marcus is ready for a larger
gift" violates Path B. Surface options; never prescribe.

Not a robo-advisor for charity, not a competitor to advisor-client
relationships, not a fiduciary, not a fund custodian, not advisor-driven
matching with scores or rankings.

### No scoring, no ranking

Nonprofit profiles, advisor discovery, GPS, pipeline — narrative-based
throughout. **Issue severity (`low`/`normal`/`high`) rates the ISSUE's
triage urgency, never a participant.** The same applies anywhere a number
or letter could be read as a judgment of a person or org.

### Brand tokens only

Warm beige bg `#FAF7F2`, bronze accent `#8B7355`, white card surfaces,
Libre Baskerville serif headings, Inter/sans body. Every color / spacing /
radius / type-size goes through a `--sh-*` token in `src/styles/tokens.css`.
**No hex literals in components.** SVG icons only (`role="button"` divs get
the bronze focus-visible ring via global selector). **Zero emoji anywhere
in the interface.** WCAG AA.

### Voice & tone (LOCKED)

Quiet, editorial. Closer to Aesop or The Atlantic than a consumer app.
- No exclamation points except in dialogue.
- No "congratulations" or celebratory language for routine task completion.
- Sentences carry weight; clauses do work.
- Meet people where they are — never imply users are at a destination.
- Spelling: standard English (Merriam-Webster). Correct silently unless the
  meaning changes.

### Aggregate-default with purposeful drill

Default landing data is aggregate (counts, sums, rollups). Record-level
queries are exposed but explicit — `connectionsByGiver()` / `openIssues()`
are separate from `connectionFunnel()` / `openIssueCount()`. UI cards drill
to record level when there's a real target; when no target exists, render a
"detail view coming soon" footnote rather than a dead click.

### Names verbatim from records

Any participant or org name in user-facing copy must come from the assembled
record's `.name` field. Never fabricate, never paraphrase. The Slice C
verify pattern asserts that issue summaries contain the linked record's name
verbatim; the same discipline applies anywhere copy references a record.

### Demonstrative vs LIVE honesty boundary

Synthetic-derived UI must be labeled demonstrative. Only genuinely live
signals (e.g., `platformHealth()` traversing actual `runChecks`) may carry
LIVE framing. On the Operations Overview, the demonstrative-state caveat
explicitly excepts Platform health; all other regions read as synthetic
seed, not live platform traction.

### Section 6 vocabulary (LOCKED)

"Between-session pipeline" (the name), "surface" (the unified verb), states
are Active / Mute / Pause, "cohort updates" is the fifth content type.
Per-client settings are "default" vs "override"; overrides are preserved
when practice-wide defaults change.

### Section 6 data reconciliation invariant

The advisor roster has **9 clients** (c-001 .. c-009). All Section 6 numbers
must reconcile:
- Each client carries a `pipeline` array: one entry per content type, with
  `state` (Active/Muted/Paused) and `source` (default/override).
- A client's `activeContent` count === entries with state Active.
- For each content type, across the 9 clients:
  `clientsOnDefault + overrides === 9`.
- `pipelineDefaults` in `content.js` matches what the client `pipeline`
  arrays actually produce.
- `advisorPracticeProfile.clientCount === 9`.

If pipeline data changes, re-derive and verify equalities BEFORE committing.

### Client roster (Phase 1)

9 fictional athletes across 4 stages (`New` / `Active` / `Mature` / `Sunset`,
renameable per advisor preference): Marcus Thompson (canonical demo —
`c-001`), Jasmine Rivera, Reuben Asare, Ezekiel Banner, Isaiah Coleman,
Tariq Williams, Bree Caldwell, Naomi Pierce, Jordan Estes. Each carries
distinct fictional substance — different sports, gift sizes, giving
identities, session histories. **Never copy-paste Marcus's content under
another name.**

### Phase 1 is athletes only

No music / entertainment / creator language in user-facing copy. Sector
terminology is locked for later phases (athletics → music → entertainment →
creator, with role / event / completion / reinvestment-term substitutions)
but must not appear in current UI text. Non-athletics sectors use "Program
Reinvestment", not "endowment".

### Connection model (Individual surface)

Share / Connect / Signal Interest behave identically regardless of
subscription tier. Funders initiate; nonprofits don't push. Discovery is
for understanding, giving is for acting — **no donate button on the
discovery view**.

### StewardHouse never authors org-level content

Only structural elements (cause tags, fields, scaffolds). Org profile
narrative is org-authored or imported (Candid API integration is future).
Organizations are referenced entities, not platform users — the unclaimed
tier of the content-sourcing model; org records appear as discovery-catalog
entries, gift targets, and connection destinations, and the Operations
Organizations directory is the operator view of those records.

## When in doubt

Ask. Don't assume. Path B violations, brand-token deviations, and Co-Authored-By
footers are non-negotiable.
